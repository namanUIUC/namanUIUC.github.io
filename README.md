# Naman Shukla - Personal Website

A clean, elegant personal portfolio website built with Astro v5.6.1 and styled with Tailwind CSS v3.4.4.

## ðŸŽ¨ Branding 

The website uses a carefully selected color palette defined in `tailwind.config.mjs`:

- **Primary**: `#9C8564` - A warm, earthy brown used for primary elements and important links
- **Secondary**: `#5E7C5D` - A soft green used for secondary elements and alternative actions
- **Tertiary**: `#7F95A3` - A muted blue-gray for supporting elements
- **Text**: `#2D2B26` - Dark gray for main text content
- **MutedText**: `#726E67` - Lighter gray for secondary text
- **Paper**: `#FAF6F0` - Soft cream background color

The typography uses two elegant Google fonts:
- **EB Garamond** - Used for headings and titles
- **Spectral** - Used for body text and general content

## ðŸ“š Website Sections

The website is organized into the following sections:

1. **About Me** - A brief introduction and professional summary
2. **Work Experience** - Timeline of professional roles and positions
3. **Education** - Academic background and qualifications
4. **Publications** - Academic and professional publications with links
5. **Talks** - Presentations and speaking engagements
6. **Software** - Software projects and tools developed
7. **Academic Projects** - Research and academic project work

Each section is built as a separate Astro component for easy maintenance and updates.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sections/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AboutMe.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AcademicProjects.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Education.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Publications.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Software.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Talks.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WorkExperience.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shared/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Footer.astro
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Sidebar.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```
Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
