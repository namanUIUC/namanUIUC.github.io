excerpt: "In this problem we are asked to estimate the number m based on observations of the stream $h \{a_1 , a 2 , \dots, a n i$, where a $ i \in \{1, 2, \dots, m \} $. Keep in mind that n and m are quite large, and the standard-approach of keeping track of the number of distinct objects we have seen up to now, is not an option."
