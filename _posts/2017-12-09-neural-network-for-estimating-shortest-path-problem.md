This is a course project of [IE532](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~swoh/courses/ie532/index.html) in 2017 Fall given by [Prof. Sewoong](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~swoh/).

We analyzed the problem and selected Deep Neural Network and Graph Convolutional Network as the architecture to be used. We generated random community graph and feed into GCN architecture by converting to a classification problem which every edge has length 1.

The final result concluded an 84% accuracy of prediction of the shortest path problem via GCN which is much higher than DNN model.
