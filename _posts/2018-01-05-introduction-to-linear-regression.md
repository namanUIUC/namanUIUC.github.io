> *Linear Regression is one of the simplest models in Machine Learning and it can be applied in serveral areas, which is pretty efficient. Having a good understanding of how things work can help you quickly home in on the appropriate model, the right training algorithm to use, and a good set of hyperparameters for your task. In this tutorial, I will introduce Linear Regression to you and how to implement it in Python from scratch.*


## Overview

Linear Regression is one of the simplest models in Machine Learning and it can be applied in serveral areas, which is pretty efficient. Understanding whatâ€™s under the hood will also help you debug issues and perform error analysis more efficiently.

There are two major approaches to train the Linear Regression Model:

1. [Closed-form Solution](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/23128/solving-for-regression-parameters-in-closed-form-vs-gradient-descent), which directly computes the model parameters.
2. Iterative Optimization approach, which is called [Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) (GD).

## Linear Regression Intuition
Linear Regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize, study and even predict relationships between variables.

1. One variable, denoted $ \textbf{x} $, is regarded as vector which implies all the features you have for the problem.
2. The other variable, denoted $ y $, is regarded as a scalar which implies the "response" which we want to predict or summarize.



## Interpretations
### Geometric interpretation




### Probabilistic model




### Loss minimization
