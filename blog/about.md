## Welcome!

I am Zhenye Na, a Master candidate in Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering [(ISE)](https://ise.illinois.edu/) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [(UIUC)](http://illinois.edu/). I am majoring in Advanced Analytics and my concentration is in Computational Science & Engeering. I am currently advised by [Prof. Justin A. Sirignano](http://jasirign.github.io/) for my graduate study.

I love playing football (not American football, LOL), it makes so relaxing, the most important is I can have a good sleep without weird dreams after that, LOL. I sometimes play PES on my laptop (wish me I have no more dues, LOL)! Please contact me if you wanna join!

I also playing [Garageband](https://www.apple.com/ios/garageband/) when I have spare time. I have played [Erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu) for 5 years (Erhu is a traditional Chinese instrument and it is also supported by Garageband in the latest release - [Garageband Erhu](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH24855?viewlocale=en_HK&locale=en_HK)).

Among so many football clubs, I love [Chelsea](http://www.chelseafc.com/) the best and [Eden Hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Hazard) is my favorite football star. This is the [overall season statistics summary](http://www.chelseafc.com/teams/first-team/eden-hazard.html) of Eden Hazard in Chelsea.
