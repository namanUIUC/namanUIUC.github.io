# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Airline Pricing

## Overview

This project applies Deep Q-Learning with batch constraints to optimize airline pricing strategies. The approach leverages historical booking data and real-time market conditions to generate optimal bid prices that maximize revenue while satisfying operational constraints.

## Challenges Addressed

- **Dynamic Market Conditions**: Airlines face constantly changing demand patterns
- **Complex Constraints**: Pricing decisions must adhere to business rules and constraints
- **Revenue Optimization**: Balancing immediate revenue with long-term value

## Technical Approach

I developed a reinforcement learning framework that:

1. **Models the Environment**: Created a simulation of passenger booking behavior
2. **Implements Batch Constraints**: Ensured pricing recommendations follow business rules
3. **Shape Constraints**: Applied monotonicity constraints to produce intuitive price curves
4. **Reward Engineering**: Designed a reward function that balances immediate bookings with future potential

## Impact

The implementation resulted in:
- 3-5% revenue increase in test markets
- Reduced pricing analyst workload by automating routine pricing decisions
- More consistent pricing patterns that improved customer trust

## Technologies Used

- Python for core implementation
- TensorFlow for deep learning models
- Ray/RLlib for distributed reinforcement learning
- Docker for containerization
- Cloud infrastructure for deployment

## Future Work

I'm currently exploring extensions including:
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning for competitive markets
- Integration with customer segmentation for personalized pricing
- Transfer learning across different flight routes
